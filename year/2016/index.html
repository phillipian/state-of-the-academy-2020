        <div class='two-col'>
          <p>On April 22, <em>The Phillipian</em>, vol. CXXXIX, sent out the 2016 &ldquo;State of the Academy&rdquo; survey to all Andover students in the hopes of attaining valuable information about the Andover community. The anonymous survey consisted of 80 questions, divided into eight main topics: general information, identity, school, drug and alcohol usage, wellness, sexual activity, and discipline.</p>
          <p>Of the 1,118 students who received the survey, <em>The Phillipian</em> received a record-high 923 complete responses – 83 percent of the student body – in the span of five days. <em>The Phillipian</em> has taken the results of the survey and organized them into several pages of graphic data pertaining to each topic.</p>
          <p style='margin-bottom: 0;'>We thank the students for their willingness to share information about themselves and their experiences, and we hope that this special issue of <em>The Phillipian</em> will both inform and enlighten the Andover community.</p>
          <em><b><p>A note about race:</b></p>
          <p>In past years, &ldquo;State of the Academy&rdquo; included the question: &ldquo;What is your race/ethnicity?&rdquo; This year, <em>The Phillipian</em> divided this question into two questions, one that asked about race and the other about ethnicity. Respondents were allowed to select more than one option for each of these questions to allow students who identify as more than one race or ethnicity to answer accordingly.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the host site of the survey collected these responses in such a way that the answers were unable to be analyzed or crossed with information from other survey questions. The data seen here was calculated by hand. Data about ethnicity could not be collected.</p></em>

              <p>Of respondents to the survey, four percent reported having sat before a Disciplinary Committee while at Andover. Twenty-four percent of respondents reported cheating on a test, quiz, or in-class assessment. </p>
              <p>Half of respondents said they had committed a major offense or had an illegal parietal without being caught. In light of December’s dorm-wide search of Taylor Hall – the first full search of a dorm in at least seven years – The Phillipian asked respondents whether they felt the administration should be able to search an entire dorm for contraband material; 51 percent of students replied “no.”</p>

              <h1>Politics</h1>
              <p>With the upcoming presidential election, The Phillipian asked students about their political beliefs. Seventeen percent of respondents identified as conservative, and 48 percent identified as liberal. Bernie Sanders is the preferred candidate of the student body, garnering 40 percent of the vote. </p>
              <p>“State of the Academy” offered the option to select presidential candidates who were in the running at the time when the survey was written and sent out. Since then, Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz have dropped out of the race.</p>
