        <p>On April 17, <i>The Phillipian</i>, vol. CXLIII, sent out the 2020 “State of the Academy” survey to all Andover students in the hopes of obtaining valuable information about the school community.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges of not being on campus, <i>The Phillipian</i> received a participation rate of 93.2 percent of the student body— 1043 participants— surpassing our expectations. The anonymous survey asked a comprehensive set of 185 questions, comprised of ten sections: General, Politics & Worldview, Wellness, Sex, Drugs & Alcohol, School, Campus Culture, Community Diversity, Discipline, and COVID-19. The 2020 issue is the first to include a Campus Culture section, as well as a COVID-19 section. We sincerely thank members of the student body for their willingness to share information and personal experiences for this special issue of <i>The Phillipian</i>, and we hope that the State of the Academy will serve to inform, enlighten, and create a more holistic narrative of the students at Andover.</p>
